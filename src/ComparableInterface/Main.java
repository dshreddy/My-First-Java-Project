 * Javaâ€™s standard library has several built-in interfaces, including Serialzable, Clonable, and Comparable interfaces.
 * The Comparable interface defines how objects are compared. It is generally implemented to sort an array of objects. It has a compareTo() method, which needs to be implemented by a concrete class.

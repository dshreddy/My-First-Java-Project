         * Imagine your camera app can switch between a basic Camera and a SmartCamera. 
         * The controls remain the same, but the results differ based on the camera. 
         * In Java, this is like a superclass reference that can refer to subclass objects. 
         * That is the Camera reference referring to the SmartCamera object. 
         * The call to the method takePicture() stays the same but triggers the overridden method from the SmartCamera class because the object belongs to the SmartCamera class, demonstrating Javaâ€™s polymorphism. 
         * This allows the app to be flexible and robust without altering the user interface.
         * This allows you to use general code with a superclass reference while benefiting from the subclass's specific behaviors.

# JAVA

1. `@Override` keyword is just for name sake
2. Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance 
3.  Overriding means creating another method with the same signature in the child class as an implemented method in the parent class. Implementing means giving curly braces to an abstract (or declared method) of the parent class. What you write inside the curly braces is not important. This is because if a child class does not implement the abstract methods of a parent class, it becomes abstract. 
4. You can use the instanceOf operator for that. It returns “true” if the object is an instance of the subclass or a class that has implemented the interface.
